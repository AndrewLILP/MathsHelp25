Questions for Carlos

if needed, you can speak about my project during class

1) Should my 3 different projects be in 1 repo or 3 different ones
Project 1 - Lite version for prototyping / practical purposes - html, bootstrap, javascript version
Project 2 - Front-end using React
Project 3 - Back-end for log-in and data storage

2) I am not sure about using tailwind - is it needed for complexity?

3) I am thinking about making a lite version for prototyping.
Can I make a basic website with html, bootstrap and javascript instead of figma or XD.
I would like a simple working version that I can use in my day job. 
I could use a combination of both as required.
