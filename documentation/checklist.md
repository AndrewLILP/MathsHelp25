Plan Your Application
This assignment will allow you to demonstrate your ability to design, develop, and deploy software applications using industry-standard practices and JavaScript frameworks. Create and deploy a fully functional software application that showcases your skills in software design and development.

Proposal

Choose an idea for your application. It could be a web or mobile app that solves a problem, entertains, educates, or serves any other purpose you find meaningful.
Write a brief project proposal (1-2 pages) outlining your idea, its features, target audience, and technology stack you plan to use. Submit this proposal for approval before starting the development.
