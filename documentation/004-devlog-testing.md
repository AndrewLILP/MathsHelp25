# MathsHelp25 Development Log
## Testing Implementation and Challenges

**Date:** June 8 2025  
**Project:** MathsHelp25 - Interactive Mathematics Teaching Resource Platform  
**Phase:** Testing Infrastructure Development  
**Status:** Tests Temporarily Removed Due to Complexity  - this doc shows better testing - documentation/002-devlog-userPermissions.md

## 📋 Project Overview

MathsHelp25 is a comprehensive web application for mathematics educators, featuring:
- **Frontend:** React 18+ with Auth0 authentication
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express with MongoDB
- **Key Features:** Role-based navigation, interactive GeoGebra tools, activity management
- **Authentication:** Auth0 with custom role management via localStorage
- **Deployment Target:** Render.com with MongoDB Atlas

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (Attempted)

### Testing Stack
- **Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library
- **Target Coverage:** Component logic, authentication flows, role-based rendering
- **Mock Dependencies:** Auth0, localStorage, React Router

### Test Categories Implemented

#### 1. **Authentication & Role Management Tests**
```
AuthWrapper Component Tests:
├── Loading States
├── Error Handling  
├── Role Detection and Assignment
├── Role Selection Flow
└── Logging and Debugging
```

#### 2. **Navigation Component Tests**
```
RoleBasedNavigation Tests:
├── Unauthenticated User Views
├── Student-Specific Navigation
├── Teacher-Specific Navigation  
├── Admin-Specific Navigation
└── User Profile Dropdown Functionality
```

#### 3. **Component Integration Tests**
```
Planned Test Coverage:
├── Subject/Topic Navigation Flow
├── Activity Creation Workflow
├── Interactive GeoGebra Integration
└── API Service Layer Testing
```

## ❌ Critical Issues Encountered

### 1. **localStorage Contamination Between Tests**

**Problem:** Tests were failing due to localStorage state persisting between test runs.

**Example Failure:**
```javascript
// Test Expected:
"⚠️ No role found for newuser@example.com, will show role selection"

// Test Received:  
"✅ Role found in localStorage: teacher for newuser@example.com"
```

**Root Cause:** Jest's localStorage mocking wasn't properly isolated between tests, causing role data from previous tests to contaminate subsequent tests.

### 2. **Auth0 Mocking Complexity**

**Challenge:** The `useAuth0` hook required complex mocking strategies that were difficult to maintain across different test scenarios.

**Issues:**
- Mock state inconsistency between components
- Difficulty simulating async authentication flows
- Role detection logic spanning multiple data sources (Auth0 metadata, localStorage)

### 3. **React Router Deprecation Warnings**

**Problem:** React Router v6 future flag warnings cluttering test output:
```
⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: Relative route resolution within Splat routes is changing in v7
```

**Impact:** Made it difficult to identify actual test failures among the warnings.

### 4. **Missing Test Infrastructure Elements**

**Discovered Needs:**
- Proper `data-testid` attributes missing from components
- Accessibility roles not properly configured for screen readers
- Component state isolation issues
